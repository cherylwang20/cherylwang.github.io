This year's [MyoChallenge](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite/myochallenge/myochallenge-2024) focuses on Physiological Dexterity and Agility in Bionic Humans. As part of the manipulation team, we develope an environment within MuJoCo that allows participants to use any controlling methods to perform a pass and place task with MyoArm and a Modular Prosthetic Limb ([MPL](https://robotsguide.com/robots/mpl)).
