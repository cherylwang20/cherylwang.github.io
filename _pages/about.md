I am currently a Ph.D. student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. [Guillaume Durandau](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/guillaume-durandau) and Prof. [Jozsef Kovecses](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/jozsef-kovecses).

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc in Physics at Trottier Space Institute [(TSI)](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/) with Prof. [Nicolas Cowan](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cowan/) and Prof. [Eve J. Lee](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~evelee/). I completed a B.S with College Honors and Departmental Highest Honors at the University of California at Los Angeles [(UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/) with Prof. [Smadar Naoz](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~snaoz/).



Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
